The main goal of the project is a satire version of the student club life.

The things I want to show is:

* People in club sacrifice a lot to be there (School marks, Social life and health)
* There is sometimes lots of drama
* That being in a club is hard


The things I want to implement are:
* Randomly generated student with stats, speciality and capability
* Randomly genereated student club with speciality, stats and competition
* The game gets harder each in-game year is pass
